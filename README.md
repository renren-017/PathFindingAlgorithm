# PathFindingAlgorithm
PathFinding is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest way between two points.
## Description
Our algorithm is based on ["A* search Algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

On the grid, you put the Starting and Ending Points and set up Barriers by pressing "left mouse button". Or remove them by pressing "Right mouse button"

Then, by pressing "space bar", you start the algorithm. In a short time you'll see the shortest route.

Also you can clean the whole grid by pressing "c"

## Feedback

1. Cool project. I guess it looks nice on portfolio, so maybe I'll try to make one by your tutorial. I think visualisation tool is good, but it would've been great to see it perform with other path finding algorithms as well.

2.This is really interesting project. I like the way algorithm works. I think this project deserves 100 points.

3. I liked the very idea that you decided to visualize the algorithm. It looks cool, and with the explanation, everything is actually easier than it seems.

4. Great project! Structure of code looks beautiful. And this algorithm can be used in more difficult and useful projects. I hope one day i could do this, and i gonna do it by your tutorial. 

5. Well played with an algorithm that finds the shortest path without spreading in all directions as I thought it will be in the beginning. I can definitely see some point for improvement, but overall the visualisation tool is great.

6. Amazing project! I saw something like that, but on another programming language, and it was hard to understand how it works. So i guess it's going to be one of the most interesting projects in our group. 

7. When Amir showed me this project, i wawnted to know how does this program findes the shortest way. I'm not the programmer, and when i started to listen the explanation, my brain almost blew up. This is really hard and interesting project. 

8. This is interesting. I like how we can see the process of considering every point on the grid and the path building. Wonder if I you can implement this algorithm into another project.

9. I think this project is great, because it's hard to make visualisation tool for any algorithm. Maybe you can try to do same project on React, so the visualisation is smoother.

10. I heard about A* algorithm before, and as i know, it's hard to visualize it. I wanted to do pathfinder algorithm too, but i thought it's too complex project, so i choosed another idea. But these two wasn't scared of difficulty and they did it! Project is really cool, especialy for beginers.
